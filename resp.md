Your question seems to slightly misstate the property you're interested in discussing. Integral domains, by definition, do not have non-zero proper ideals that are fields because fields are not ideals in another ring, except the trivial case where the field is considered as a ring with itself. However, it seems you might be asking about how the field of fractions (sometimes referred to as the fraction field or the field of quotients) of an integral domain showcases the property that it is the smallest field containing the integral domain. Let's clarify these concepts.

### Integral Domains and Fields

- **Integral Domain:** An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity (1 â‰  0) that has no zero divisors. That is, if \(ab = 0\) in an integral domain, then either \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\).
  
- **Field:** A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element is invertible. This means, for every non-zero element \(a\), there exists an element \(b\) in the field such that \(ab = ba = 1\).

### The Field of Fractions

Given an integral domain \(R\), we can construct a field, often called the fraction field or field of fractions of \(R\), denoted by \(F(R)\) or simply \(F\), which contains an isomorphic copy of \(R\). The elements of \(F\) can be seen as fractions \(\frac{a}{b}\) where \(a, b \in R\) and \(b \neq 0\). The construction ensures every element of \(R\) embeds into \(F\) via the mapping \(a \mapsto \frac{a}{1}\), and \(F\) is the smallest field containing \(R\).

### Proof Sketch that \(F\) is a Field

1. **Well-defined:** First, we define an equivalence relation on the set of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) with \(a, b \in R\) and \(b \neq 0\) by \((a, b) \sim (c, d)\) if and only if \(ad = bc\). This relation is well-defined, reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

2. **Addition and Multiplication:** We define addition and multiplication on the equivalence classes \([a, b]\) (denoting the class of pairs equivalent to \((a, b)\)) as follows:
   - **Addition:** \([a, b] + [c, d] = [ad + bc, bd]\)
   - **Multiplication:** \([a, b] \cdot [c, d] = [ac, bd]\)
   
   These operations are well-defined due to the equivalence relation and respect the field axioms.

3. **Inverses:** For any non-zero element \([a, b]\) in \(F\), its multiplicative inverse is \([b, a]\) since \(a, b \in R\) and \(R\) has no zero divisors; hence \(a\neq 0\) implies \(b/a\) is a valid inverse in \(F\).

4. **Smallest Field:** Since every element of \(R\) can be represented in \(F\) as \([a, 1]\), and operations in \(F\) restrict to operations in \(R\) when considering these elements, \(F\) contains an isomorphic copy of \(R\). Any field containing \(R\) must also be able to represent fractions of the form \(\frac{a}{b}\), hence must at least be as "large" as \(F\).

This construction and the sketched properties effectively show that the field of fractions \(F(R)\) is a field containing \(R\) and is the smallest such field in the sense that it is essentially generated by elements of \(R\) themselves under the operations of addition and multiplication as defined in a field.
